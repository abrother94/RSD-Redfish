# OpenStack Compute Node configuration for IntelÂ® Rack Scale Architecture

This is a brief guide of setting up an OS image to be booted
as RackScale Composed Node and acting as Compute Node for OpenStack (Juno).

It is assumed that user is familiar with OpenStack configuration process
or already have an OpenStack environment configured. Otherwise please consult
http://docs.openstack.org/juno/install-guide/install/apt/content/
to perform fresh installation of OpenStack Juno environment.

Networks on OpenStack Controller and Compute Node should be configured using
following RackScale networks:
1) VLAN 100 (subnet 100.100.100.0/24) for OpenStack Management Network;
2) VLAN 200 (subnet 200.200.200.0/24) for OpenStack Data Network;
3) RackScale Public Network (subnet 10.1.0.0/24) for OpenStack Public Network.
When configuring static IP addresses, please make sure that they have
the same last octet for networks 100 and 200.

Please ensure that all switches between OpenStack Compute Node and OpenStack
Controller are configured to allow communication over these networks.

To setup an OpenStack Compute Node it is required to install Nova and Neutron,
(including neutron-plugin-ml2 and neutron-plugin-openvswitch-agent)

Configuration of OpenStack Compute Node components are performed by scripts:
  /etc/init/
      psme-openstack-attach.conf (invoke node setup for OpenStack during startup)
      psme-openstack-detach.conf (invoke node removal from OpenStack during shutdown)
  /root/
      setup_node.sh (main node setup script)
      remove_node.sh (main node removal script)
          configs/
              ml2_conf.ini (preconfigured Modular Layer 2 OpenStack Neutron plugin)
              neutron.conf (preconfigured OpenStack Neutron)
              nova.conf (preconfigured OpenStack Nova)
              restore/* (for restoring configuration during removal)

Neutron and Nova configurations (neutron.conf, nova.conf) contain preconfigured
credentials (default password for OpenStack services: "openstack", and "guest" for RabbitMQ),
so they should be adjusted when connecting to existing OpenStack environment.
